## Key Highlights

- Compared NDVI, SAVI, and EVI for estimating green and total pasture biomass  
- GAMs outperformed linear regression in capturing non-linear patterns  
- SAVI was best for green biomass (RÂ² = 0.52); NDVI better for total biomass (RÂ² = 0.43)  
- PlanetScope captured fractional cover variability for land management
