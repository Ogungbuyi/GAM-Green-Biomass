## Key Highlights

- Compared NDVI, SAVI, and EVI for estimating green and total pasture biomass  
- GAMs outperformed linear regression in capturing non-linear patterns  
- SAVI was best for green biomass, while NDVI is better for total biomass (dry and green biomass)  
- PlanetScope captured fractional cover variability for land management
